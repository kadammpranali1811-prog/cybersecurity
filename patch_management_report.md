## What is Patch Management?
Patch management involves identifying, testing, and applying updates to operating systems, applications, and network devices. These updates fix known weaknesses that attackers could exploit.

---

## Why Patch Management is Important
Software vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. Hackers use these weaknesses to gain access to systems. Applying patches closes these security gaps and prevents attacks.

## Consequences of Not Applying Patches
Failure to update systems can lead to:

- Malware and ransomware infections  
- Data breaches  
- System crashes  
- Loss of customer trust  
- Legal and financial penalties

## Real-World Example
In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack infected thousands of computers worldwide. The attack spread because many systems had not installed a security patch released by Microsoft earlier.
