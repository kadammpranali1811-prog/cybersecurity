Social Engineering Attacks Report

Introduction

Social engineering attacks manipulate people into revealing confidential information. Instead of hacking computers, attackers hack human behavior by exploiting trust, fear, and curiosity.


This report discusses three common social engineering attacks:

Phishing
Pretexting
Baiting

1. Phishing
How it Works
Phishing is when attackers send fake emails or messages pretending to be from trusted companies such as banks, Amazon, or Google. The victim is tricked into clicking malicious links and entering passwords or credit card details.

Real-World Case
In 2020, Twitter employees were targeted by phishing attacks that allowed hackers to take over verified accounts and post cryptocurrency scams.

Impact
Financial loss
Identity theft
Data breaches
Prevention
Train employees
Use email filtering
Verify links before clicking
Enable two-factor authentication


2. Pretexting
How it Works
In pretexting, attackers create a fake story (pretext) to trick victims into giving sensitive data. For example, pretending to be IT support.

Real-World Case
In 2015, attackers used pretexting to steal employee data from a major US company by posing as HR staff.

Impact
Leakage of personal information
Fraud
Loss of company trust
Prevention
Verify caller identity
Follow company security policies
Do not share confidential data over phone


3. Baiting
How it Works
Baiting uses something attractive (like free software or USB drives) to lure victims into malware traps.

Real-World Case
Hackers left infected USB drives in parking lots of companies. When employees plugged them in, malware was installed.

Impact
Malware infection
Network compromise
Data loss
Prevention
Avoid unknown USB drives
Use antivirus software
Educate employees
Conclusion
Social engineering attacks are dangerous because they exploit human trust. Organizations must educate employees, use strong security systems, and enforce strict data protection policies to reduce these risks.
