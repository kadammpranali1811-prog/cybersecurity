# Network Security Threats Report

## Introduction
Network security threats are attacks that attempt to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal information from computer networks. Understanding these threats helps in protecting systems and data from cyber-attacks.

This report explains three major network threats:
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- Spoofing

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

### How it Works
A DoS attack floods a target system or network with too many requests. This overloads the server and prevents real users from accessing services.

### Impact
- Website becomes unavailable  
- Business operations stop  
- Financial loss  
- User frustration  

### Real-World Example
In 2016, a massive DoS attack on Dyn DNS caused websites like Twitter, Netflix, and PayPal to go offline.

### Prevention
- Use firewalls  
- Enable rate-limiting  
- Use intrusion detection systems  
- Use cloud-based protection services

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

### How it Works
In a MITM attack, a hacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties. The attacker can read or change the data being sent.

### Impact
- Passwords can be stolen  
- Banking details leaked  
- Sensitive information exposed  

### Real-World Example
Hackers often perform MITM attacks on public Wi-Fi networks in cafes or airports.

### Prevention
- Use HTTPS websites  
- Use VPNs  
- Avoid public Wi-Fi  
- Enable encryption

## 3. Spoofing Attack

### How it Works
In spoofing, attackers pretend to be a trusted device or user. They fake IP addresses, emails, or websites to trick victims.

### Impact
- Data theft  
- Malware installation  
- Unauthorized access  

### Real-World Example
Phishing emails pretending to be from banks are common spoofing attacks.

### Prevention
- Use email filtering  
- Verify sender addresses  
- Use authentication methods  
- Use secure protocols

## Conclusion
Network security threats like DoS, MITM, and spoofing can cause serious damage. By understanding how these attacks work and using security measures like firewalls, encryption, and authentication, organizations can protect their networks and data.

This report highlights the importance of cyber-security awareness and proper network protection.
